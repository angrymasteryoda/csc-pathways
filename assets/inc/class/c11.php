					An introduction to microprocessor architecture and assembly language programming. The relationship between the hardware and the software will be studied in order to understand the interaction between a program and the total system. Mapping of statements and constructs in a high-level language onto sequences of machine instructions is  studied as  well as  the  internal representation of simple data types and structures. Numerical computation is performed, noting the various data representation errors and potential procedural errors. 54  hours lecture and 18  hours laboratory. (TBA option)
